# ECE 314 Probability in Engineering Lab Fall 2020

All lab files. In each lab folder, labx.ipynb is the raw material, myLabx is the file I submitted.

I don't submit Lab 0 and Lab14 because the former one is for introduction and the last one can be dropped.


Lab3 and Lab12 both receive 98/100 credits, while the other submitted labs receive full credits.

+ for lab3: Problem 3.3: -2     1-cdf(299)
+ for lab 12: Problem 2.2: -2     You should solve this problem theoretically like problem 1 and derive turnaround time being 𝑆/𝑛 > 𝛾/𝑐
