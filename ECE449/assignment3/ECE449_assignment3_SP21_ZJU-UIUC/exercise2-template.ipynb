    "## Implementing K-means\n",
    "The K-means algorithm is a method to automatically cluster similar data examples together. Concretely, a given training set ${x^(1),…,x^(m)}( where\\ x(i)∈R^n)$ will be grouped into a few cohesive “clusters”. The intuition behind K-means is an iterative procedure that starts by guessing the initial centroids, and then refines this guess by repeatedly assigning examples to their closest centroids and then recomputing the centroids based on the assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inner-loop of the algorithm repeatedly carries out two steps:\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>Assigning each training example $x(i)$ to its closest centroid, and</li>\n",
    "<li>Recomputing the mean of each centroid using the points assigned to it.</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "The K-means algorithm will always converge to some final set of means for the centroids. Note that the converged solution may not always be ideal and depends on the initial setting of the centroids. Therefore, in practice the K-means algorithm is usually run a few times with different random initializations. One way to choose between these different solutions from different random initializations is to choose the one with the lowest cost function value (distortion).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding Closest Centroids\n",
    "In the “cluster assignment” phase of the K-means algorithm, the algorithm assigns every training example $x(i)$ to its closest centroid, given the current positions of centroids. Specifically, for every example $i$ it is set\n",

Note that $c^{(i)}$ corresponds to $idx[i]$ in the code in findClosestCentroids. This function takes the data matrix $X$ and the locations of all centroids inside centroids and should output a one-dimensional array $idx$ that holds the index (a value in ${1,...,K}$, where $K$ is total number of centroids) of the closest centroid to every training example. This can be implemented by using a loop over every training example and every centroid."

    "## Image Compression with K-means\n",
    "K-means will be applied to image compression. In a straightforward 24-bit color representation of an image, each pixel is represented as three 8-bit unsigned integers (ranging from 0 to 255) that specify the red, green and blue intensity values. This encoding is often refered to as the RGB encoding. A sample 24-bit color image contains thousands of colors, which can be reduced to 16 colors.\n",
    "\n",
    "By making this reduction, it is possible to represent (compress) the photo in an efficient way. Specifically, there is only need to store the RGB values of the 16 selected colors, and for each pixel in the image now it is needed to only store the index of the color at that location (where only 4 bits are necessary to represent 16 possibilities).\n",
    "\n",
    "The K-means algorithm will be applied to select the 16 colors that will be used to represent the compressed image. Concretely, every pixel will be treated in the original image as a data example and the K-means algorithm will be used to find the 16 colors that best group (cluster) the pixels in the 3-dimensional RGB space. Once the cluster centroids have been computed on the image, then the 16 colors will be used to replace the pixels in the original image.\n",
    "\n",
    "### K-means on Pixels\n",
    "The following code first loads the image, and then reshapes it to create a m×3 matrix of pixel colors (where m=16384=128×128), and calls the K-means function on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "After finding the top K = 16 colors to represent the image, each pixel position can now be assigned to its closest centroid using the findClosestCentroids function. This allows to represent the original image using the centroid assignments of each pixel. Notice that the number of bits that are required to describe the image have been significantly reduced. The original image required 24 bits for each one of the 128×128 pixel locations, resulting in total size of 128×128×24=393,216 bits. The new representation requires some overhead storage in form of a dictionary of 16 colors, each of which require 24 bits, but the image itself then only requires 4 bits per pixel location. The final number of bits used is therefore 16×24+128×128×4=65,920 bits, which corresponds to compressing the original image by about a factor of 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the effects of the compression can be viewed by reconstructing the image based only on the centroid assignments. Specifically, each pixel location can be replaced with the mean of the centroid assigned to it. Even though the resulting image retains most of the characteristics of the original, we also see some compression artifacts."
