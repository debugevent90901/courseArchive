    Problem: When setting line comparator register's value to (IMAGE_Y_DIM - (FONT_HEIGHT+2)),
                the screen exactly splitted into half and not expected.
    Solution: Multiply the register's value by 2, i.e. 2*(IMAGE_Y_DIM - (FONT_HEIGHT+2)), which is
                because VGA uses 2 scanning line.

    Problem: The status bar had correct location, but was not initialized to black color. Instead,
                it just showed what was displayed on the top of the screen.
    Solution: Changed the target_img in set_mode_X function to 0x05A0, which is the addresses needed
                by the status bar.

    Problem: After the status bar had correct location and initialized to black color, in the maze
                game the player can still move beyond below the status bar and being blocked.
    Solution: Reset the value of SCROLL_Y_DIM, subscribe it with 18(the height of a status bar). Now the
                player would not go into it.

    Problem: The text on the status bar was a little high.
    Solution: When calculating the initial offset, forget to add another STATUS_BAR_X_DIM (the
                empty pixel line above).

    Problem: The time displayed on the status bar flashed much faster than normal time.
    Solution: When inputting time argument to text2image routine, first divided it by the
                update frequency of the RTC.

    Problem: Masking technique worked, but the player would leave another shadow in the starting
                point and not disappear.
    Solution: I only apply masking inside the loop once, which should also be applied to initialized
                outside the while loop.

    Problem: When a fruit was near a wall, the player walked on it and stopped, but the fruit would 
                not disappear until the player moved away.
    Solution: Modify the unveil_around_player function and add another static variable in the mazegame.c file,
                unveil_around_player would keep track whether a fruit is meet by player and set that static
                variable, if_meet_fruit. And in my masking function, if this signal or need_redraw signal is high,
                there should be a screen update.

    Problem: The texts on the status bar about the number of fruits neglect the Plural Form. i.e. 2 fruits, 1 fruit
                and 0 fruit.
    Solution: Add an if-statement to distinguish the Plural Form.

    Problem: The text on the status bar was not centered.
    Solution: I used a fixed-length array to hold the string, and I should use strlen() to get its actual length. So the
                calculation could be right

    Problem: The floating message showed beyond the upper edge of the screen.
    Solution: I used an extra conditional statement, if the y-coordinate is < 0, then keep decrement until >=0.

    Problem: The text of the message is transparent, but not white.
    Solution: I misuse the palette, which should be background color or (background color + 64). At first I wrongly 
                set it as background color or (text color + 64). So it is still kind of transparent, but not as we 
                desire.

    Problem: the floating message on the screen kept flashing and is not sync with frames
    Solution: I update the screen (show_screen()) more than once in the rtc_thread, which makes the screen "flash". As 
                a result, I integrate the masking function and the floating message function, which both needs a update, 
                and change the logic of the triggering to make sure there is only one update in a frame.

    Problem: The compiler continuously report me the error about ";", while I am confident that my code are correct.
    Solution: It is a stupid mistake, I mistakenly add a ";" to the end of a macro, which I took really a long time to debug,
                so I think it necessary to record it.

    Problem: When I type sudo ./mazegame, nothing happened and the vm logged out and require me to log again.
    Solution: I made a typo in the main function of mazegame.c. It should be fd = open("/dev/rtc", O_RDONLY, 0);
                fd_tux = open("/dev/ttyS0", O_RDWR | O_NOCTTY). But I typed fd twice. i.e. open two files to fd.
                Though it is a simple, stupid mistake but its bahavior is really weird and I don't know why. So I 
                record it.

    Problem: The game freezes at the exit.
    Solution: From the piazza I know at the end of the main function is mazegame.c, we should use pthread_cancel(tid3) instead of
                pthread_join(tid3), which close the thread.
